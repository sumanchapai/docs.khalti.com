Signup as a merchant and as a User 2. Understand Khalti payment process 2.1. Transaction States 1. Initiated 2. Confirmed 3. Completed 4. Disabled 5. Refunded 6. Partially refunded 7. Failed 3. Test integration 3.1. Client side integration 3.2. Server side integration 4. Go live 4.1. Further processes 1. Signup as a merchant and as a User \u00b6 First of all you will need a merchant and a consumer accounts. Merchant is an online business service like e-commerce websites, ISP online payment, Movie online purchase etc. Consumer is an end user who uses Khalti to purchase products or services from merchants.

Transaction States \u00b6 1. Initiated \u00b6 It is the first state of a transaction. Transactions are initiated after mobile number and khalti pin along with other transaction details are provided. 2. Confirmed \u00b6 A transaction is confirmed after transaction details (transaction token, confirmation_code and 3rd party transaction_pin) are provided by the consumer. Check how to set and update khalti pin here. 3. Completed \u00b6 Merchant server then requests khalti server to verify the transaction. After the transaction is in completed state consumer is informed the transaction was successfully completed. 4. Disabled \u00b6 A transaction could be disabled due to the possibility of 'confirmation_code' exploitation. 5. Refunded \u00b6 A merchant can refund the successful payments within a limited period of time. 6. Partially refunded \u00b6 A completed transaction also can be partially refunded. 7. Failed \u00b6 Normally, a successful transaction has at least three changes of states initiate, confirm and complete. A client first initiates and then confirms payment while the server finally verifies it and the payment process is completed. 3. Test integration \u00b6 Now that you know how Khalti payment works. Its time to integrate it into your system. A merchant must complete test integration using test keys . Test keys start with test_ . In test mode, transactions are sandboxed, which means fund is not moved from a consumer to the merchant. Khalti must to be integrated at client and server. Payment via E-Banking and Debit/Credit card is not supported in the test environment. After you successfully integrate wallet, you need not to concern about E-Banking and Card payment integration. 3.1. Client side integration \u00b6 For now there is only one way to integrate Khalti at client side, through SDKs. We have developed SDKs for every major plaforms and we call it Checkout . Checkouts provide all the necessary UIs and perform necessary processes to initiate and confirm payment. Web kit Android kit iOS kit Flutter kit 3.2. Server side integration \u00b6 After user confirms payment, it has to be verified by Khalti. Fund from user account is moved to merchant only if verification succeeds. Verification must be done by the merchant server using a secret key. Verification API Transaction API 4. Go live \u00b6 After successful integration test, live keys will be generated in the merchant dashboard. The merchant must replace test keys with live ones . Live keys start with live_X . Replace test_public_X and test_secret_X keys with live_public_X and live_secret_X keys respectively. 4.1. Further processes \u00b6 Even successful integration itself doesn't let you receive payments above NRs. 200 per transaction.

If the currently available options failed to meet your requirement leave us your feedback . 7. What can I resolve an issue while installing the plugin ? \u00b6 First, check if cURL is enabled. You should check if you miss out any dependency or extension. There might be common SSL issues. You can also tweak the code (of the plugin you got from GitHub) on your own. For debugging paste this in your code to get the configuration and predefined variables. <?php phpinfo();?> Also, see your server log. 8. What is Khalti mPIN? \u00b6 Khalti mPIN is the four digit pin, used by the user while making payment of third party transactions. It can created or changed at the Transaction Pin section under Account in khalti web and Settings in khalti app. 9. I need to refund payment to the user. How can I refund a transaction? \u00b6 You can refund the payment to the user from your dashboard. Gotchas \u00b6 CORS issues \u00b6 If you are getting CORS issues, read the docs again very thoroughly. You need to call verification API from your server to verify, so it is necessary to pass the data to your server first. Server errors \u00b6 If you get error response \"Fee not found.\" while testing, check your fee and set fee between Rs. 10 to Rs. 200. If you are using live keys contact merchant support to find your transaction limits. Payment errors \u00b6 If you get error response \"Amount must be less than 200.\" while testing, check you have complete all the contract process. If you are using live keys contact merchant support for further details. Frame Options and Clickjacking protection \u00b6 Refused to display 'https://khalti.com/payment/widget/' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'deny'. You are using HTTP response header 'X-Frame-Options' that avoids <iframe> rendering when you set it to 'deny'. But Khalti gateway uses iframe payment form, to accept payment from Khalti you need to allow iframe at least for khalti.com. You have a configuration option 'allow-from' with x-frame-options to allow from a specific domain. You can simply do this in your server configuration: X-Frame-Options \"allow-from https://khalti.com\" But using x-frame-options is not an internet standard. It is almost absolute; modern browsers like chrome and safari don't support it. The recommended way is to use 'frame-ancestors' CSP rule. (legacy browsers like IE do not support it ). So also for this error: Refused to display 'https://khalti.com/payment/widget/' in a frame because an ancestor violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \"frame-ancestors 'none'\". You need to configure the server as: Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors 'self' khalti.com *.khalti.com One can use both the options for full browser compatibility.

The keys for additional data must be prefixed with merchant_ . A sample request adhering to the above signature will look something like this: { \"public_key\" : \"live_public_key_546eb6da05544d7d88961db04fdb9721\" , \"mobile\" : \"9842XXXXXX\" , \"amount\" : 10000 , \"product_identity\" : \"book/id-120\" , \"product_name\" : \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" , \"bank\" : \"Yy6jFwuwssihs77PHGjwAZ\" , \"source\" : \"web\" } With this request khalti server will redirect your client to bank portal where user can access e-banking, finally redirecting back to original/parent page with the response.

So, while implementing it needs to listen the storage event and read localstorage value as data with the key confirmation-data . The example is like this: window.addEventListener(\"storage\", function (event) { if (event.key == \"confirmation-data\") { data = JSON.parse(event.newValue); // this is the final response with looks json shown below window.localStorage.removeItem(\"confirmation-data\"); } }); Finally, a successful request will yield a response that looks something like this: { \"token\" : \"VGMyaKVDQQyorBiQ3W99WL\" , \"amount\" : 10000 , \"mobile\" : \"98XXXXX099\" , \"product_identity\" : \"book/id-120\" , \"product_name\" : \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" } 3. Verify transaction \u00b6 The API requests mentioned in previous steps are to be made from the client side i.e. from the front-end. Once those steps are complete, you need to make a verification request using your secret key from the server. See http://docs.khalti.com/api/verification/ for more information on how to verify the transaction. Notes \u00b6 While testing you might need to interact with actual system of banks. There is no sandbox or testing environment for using banking system. Prevent parent page (that initiates redirection) for closing until payment process is not completed.

Do 'pod install'. Objective-C : Clone project and use 'Example Obj-c' directory. Do 'pod install'. Installation guide \u00b6 Khalti is available through CocoaPods . To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile: pod ' Khalti ' Usage \u00b6 Adding CustomSchme \u00b6 Khalti uses custom Scheme: So merhant should setup URLScheme unique for their app. We have made usability as of user case. After adding Url Scheme create global constant for same customUrlScheme as below let khaltiUrlScheme : String = \"KhaltiPayExampleScheme\" Requirements \u00b6 To work around with this redirection you have to implement some openUrl in Appdelegate.swift . Khalti.shared.defaultAction() returns true if you initiate payment through Khalti. Khalti.shared.action(with: url) is needed for complete action after ebanking and card payment. Note: Using Khalti.shared.action(with: url) is mandatory. Add following code to Appdelegate.swift func application ( _ application : UIApplication , open url : URL , sourceApplication : String ?, annotation : Any ) -> Bool { Khalti . shared . action ( with : url ) return Khalti . shared . defaultAction () // Or true } Using at particular ViewController \u00b6 At your viewController during action of pay add initiate config file When instantiating Config pass public key, product id, product name, amount (in paisa).

Additionally, Config class also accepts a Dictionary which you can use to pass any additional data. Make sure you add a merchant_ prefix in your map key. Using delegates \u00b6 The viewController you implement pay action should contain KhaltiPayDelegate implementing onCheckOutSuccess(data: Dictionary<String, Any>) onCheckOutError(action: String, message: String) extension YourViewController : KhaltiPayDelegate { func onCheckOutSuccess ( data : Dictionary < String , Any >) { print ( data ) print ( \"Oh there is success message received\" ) } func onCheckOutError ( action : String , message : String ) { print ( action ) print ( message ) print ( \"Oh there occure error in payment\" ) } } Summary \u00b6 Callback Methods \u00b6 Method Description onCheckOutSuccess(data: Dictionary<String, Any>) This method is called when a transaction has been completed and confirmed by the user. A dictionary containing an access token, required to verify the transaction and data passed through Config instance is returned. Once this method is called, use the access token to verify the transaction. Please follow the verification process for further instructions. onCheckOutError(action: String, message: String, data:Dictionary<String,Any>?)

Please follow the new setup after upgrading to 2.0 in order to fix the issue. Setup \u00b6 Detailed setup for each platform. Android \u00b6 In your app's AndroidManifest.xml , add these lines inside <activity>...</activity> tag: <meta-data android:name= \"flutter_deeplinking_enabled\" android:value= \"true\" /> <intent-filter android:autoVerify= \"true\" > <action android:name= \"android.intent.action.VIEW\" /> <category android:name= \"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" /> <category android:name= \"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" /> <data android:scheme= \"kpg\" android:host= \"{your package name}\" /> </intent-filter> iOS \u00b6 In your app's Info.plist , add these properties: <key> FlutterDeepLinkingEnabled </key> <true/> <key> CFBundleURLTypes </key> <array> <dict> <key> CFBundleTypeRole </key> <string> Editor </string> <key> CFBundleURLSchemes </key> <array> <string> kpg </string> </array> <key> CFBundleURLName </key> <string> {your package name} </string> </dict> </array> Web \u00b6 No configuration is required for web. Desktop \u00b6 No configuration is required for desktop. Initialization \u00b6 Wrap the topmost widget of your app with KhaltiScope widget. And add supported locales and KhaltiLocalizations.delegate as shown below. Navigator Approach \u00b6 When using MaterialApp or siblings. KhaltiScope ( publicKey: < public - key > , builder: ( context , navigatorKey ) { return MaterialApp ( navigatorKey: navigatorKey , supportedLocales: const [ Locale ( 'en' , 'US' ), Locale ( 'ne' , 'NP' ), ], localizationsDelegates: const [ KhaltiLocalizations . delegate , ... ], ... ); } ); Router Approach \u00b6 When using MaterialApp.router or siblings. final routerDelegate = YourRouterDelegate (); KhaltiScope ( publicKey: < public - key > , navigatorKey: routerDelegate . navigatorKey , builder: ( context , _ ) { return MaterialApp . router ( routerDelegate: routerDelegate , supportedLocales: const [ Locale ( 'en' , 'US' ), Locale ( 'ne' , 'NP' ), ], localizationsDelegates: const [ KhaltiLocalizations . delegate , ... ], ... ); } ); Launching Payment Interface \u00b6 Khalti Payment interface can be launched in two ways: Using KhaltiButton \u00b6 The plugin includes easy to use button to launch the payment interface. It can be used as shown below: final config = PaymentConfig ( amount: 10000 , // Amount should be in paisa productIdentity: 'dell-g5-g5510-2021' , productName: 'Dell G5 G5510 2021' , productUrl: 'https://www.khalti.com/#/bazaar' , additionalData: { // Not mandatory; can be used for reporting purpose 'vendor' : 'Khalti Bazaar' , }, ) KhaltiButton ( config: config , preferences: [ // Not providing this will enable all the payment methods. PaymentPreference . khalti , PaymentPreference . eBanking , ], onSuccess: ( successModel ) { // Perform Server Verification }, onFailure: ( failureModel ) { // What to do on failure? }, onCancel: () { // User manually cancelled the transaction }, ), If you want to use only specific payment method then the following dedicated buttons can be used instead: - KhaltiButton.wallet(...) - KhaltiButton.eBanking(...) - KhaltiButton.mBanking(...) - KhaltiButton.connectIPS(...) - KhaltiButton.sct(...) Manual Method \u00b6 Another method to launch the payment interface is using KhaltiScope.pay() method: Inkwell ( onTap: () { KhaltiScope . of ( context ). pay ( config: config , preferences: [ PaymentPreference . connectIPS , PaymentPreference . eBanking , PaymentPreference . sct , ], onSuccess: onSuccess , onFailure: onFailure , onCancel: onCancel , ); }, child: Text ( 'Launch Payment Interface' ), ); Customizing Return URL \u00b6 Their might be a need to use custom returnUrl , specially in Web platform. Passing a custom return url will result in data url, in following format after successful payment. <returnUrl>/?<data> e.g. Let's say you set a returnUrl = 'https://example.com/test'; . Then the data url will be https://example.com/test/?key=value . A custom return url can be set in PaymentConfig : final config = PaymentConfig ( returnUrl: 'https://example.com/test' , ... ); Customizing UI \u00b6 This package doesn't support high level of customization as this is more of a plug & play package. If a custom interface is required then khalti package can be used. Example \u00b6 Find more detailed example here . Server Verification \u00b6 After success from the client side payment, the next step is to perform server verification. A server verification is required since the client side makes the payment directly to Khalti without going through your server first, you need to be sure that the customer actually paid the money they were supposed to before completing their order. This type of verification can only be done securely from the server. Know how to perform server verification here . Contributing \u00b6 Contributions are always welcome. Also, if you have any confusion, please feel free to create an issue. Internationalization \u00b6 Steps to add support for new language 1. Create a new file for the language khalti_localizations_<language-code>.dart inside localization directory. Let's say you want to add support for Nepali language, then the file should be khalti_localizations_ne.dart . Copy contents of khalti_localizations_en.dart to the newly created file and rename the class accordingly. Replace all the strings with the localized strings inside the file. Add entry to _localizations map inside khalti_localizations.dart . dart const Map<String, KhaltiLocalizations> _localizations = { 'en': _KhaltiLocalizationsEn(), 'ne': _KhaltiLocalizationsNe(), // Newly added entry }; Submit a Pull Request with the changes.
